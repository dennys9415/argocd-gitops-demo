# GitOps Concepts

## What is GitOps?

GitOps is a modern approach to continuous delivery that uses Git as the single source of truth for declarative infrastructure and applications.

### Core Principles

1. **Declarative**: The entire system is described declaratively
2. **Versioned and Immutable**: Desired state is stored in a way that enforces immutability and versioning
3. **Automated**: Approved changes to the desired state are automatically applied to the system
4. **Continuously Reconciled**: Software agents ensure the actual state matches the desired state

## ArgoCD Architecture

### Components

- **API Server**: Exposes the API for the Web UI and CLI
- **Repository Server**: Maintains application manifests cache
- **Application Controller**: Monitors applications and compares actual vs desired state
- **Redis**: Caches manifests and application data

### How It Works

1. **Desired State**: Defined in Git repository
2. **Actual State**: Current state in Kubernetes cluster
3. **Reconciliation**: ArgoCD continuously compares desired vs actual state
4. **Sync**: If differences found, ArgoCD applies changes to match desired state

## Kustomize for Environment Management

### Base and Overlays

- **Base**: Common configuration shared across environments
- **Overlays**: Environment-specific customizations

### Example Structure

```
apps/
├── base/ # Common configuration
│ ├── kustomization.yaml
│ ├── deployment.yaml
│ └── service.yaml
├── overlays/
│ ├── development/ # Development-specific changes
│ ├── staging/ # Staging-specific changes
│ └── production/ # Production-specific changes
```


## Deployment Strategies

### Blue-Green Deployment

- Two identical environments (blue and green)
- Only one environment receives live traffic
- Switch traffic between environments for zero-downtime deployments

### Canary Deployment

- Gradually roll out changes to a small subset of users
- Monitor for issues before full rollout
- Controlled risk deployment

### Rolling Update

- Default Kubernetes deployment strategy
- Gradually replaces old pods with new ones
- Minimal downtime during updates

## Benefits of GitOps

### Improved Security
- Git provides a single source of truth
- All changes are auditable and traceable
- Rollback capabilities through Git history

### Increased Productivity
- Automated deployment processes
- Faster recovery from failures
- Consistent environments

### Enhanced Reliability
- Declarative configuration reduces human error
- Automated testing and validation
- Self-healing systems

## Best Practices

### Repository Structure
- Separate application and infrastructure repositories
- Use environment-specific branches or directories
- Include documentation and examples

### Security
- Use RBAC for fine-grained access control
- Implement network policies
- Scan for vulnerabilities in container images

### Monitoring
- Monitor application health and performance
- Set up alerts for synchronization failures
- Track deployment metrics

## Common Patterns

### App of Apps Pattern
- Parent application manages child applications
- Enables management of multiple related applications
- Simplifies complex deployment scenarios

### Multi-Cluster Deployment
- Deploy applications across multiple clusters
- Centralized management through Git
- Environment-specific cluster configurations

### Secrets Management
- Use external secrets management (Vault, Sealed Secrets)
- Never store secrets in Git
- Automate secret rotation and distribution
